UI should display the list of nodes and edges with attributes. For now everything is pre-computed (neighbours, shortest path), but a more efficient strategy may be to generate them on the fly, but the possibility for bi-directionality in such use case needs to be confirmed.

Is the removal of isolated nodes only relevant for viz display or would users need to remove them in graph object?
