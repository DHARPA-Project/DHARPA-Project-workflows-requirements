This repository aims at documenting the collection of workflow examples in the context of the DHARPA project, in order to identify data patterns and features for implementation.

At the moment, additional relevant workflow examples can be added by simply creating a new file using the "blank-workflow.md" template.

Each example contains the following sections:
* Data: description of the data used in the example
* Workflow: information about the goals of the workflow
* Steps: the different steps considered
* Implementation: this section enables to inform about implementation status of features selected for implementation, and links to the relevant DHARPA repo.
